### Topic: COVID Testing Information System (CTIS)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Connect to MongoDB database
First, access the database at `https://account.mongodb.com/account/login`. The credentials for the MongoDB database are as follows:
<br> Username: adibdibzie@gmail.com
<br> Password: adibraup293

Next, go to **Network Access** and select **Add IP Address** (the green button on the right). Then, click the **Add Current IP Address** button and click the **Confirm** button. Your current IP address will be added to the IP access list.

After that, run `node server.js` for checking the connection to database. The command prompt should show 'Connected to database' as the output message.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
